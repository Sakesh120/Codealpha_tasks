💡 How It Works

Click on any image in the gallery.

A modal box opens showing the selected image with an overlay background.

Use the Next (›) or Previous (‹) buttons to navigate through images.

Click the Close (×) button or anywhere outside the image to exit the modal view.


📱 Responsive Design

The gallery automatically adjusts to various screen sizes:

Desktop: 4 images per row

Tablet: 3 images per row

Mobile: 2 images per row

🧩 Future Enhancements (Optional Ideas)

Add keyboard navigation support (arrow keys and Escape key).

Include captions or image descriptions.

Add image zoom or lightbox animation.

Implement lazy loading for performance optimization.
